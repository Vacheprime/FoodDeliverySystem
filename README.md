# Food Delivery System
Final project of the Programming Patterns course (Fall 2024).

Our project is a food delivery system that allows the users to sign in as a client or an employee, order food from multiple locations of a restaurant, track orders, or view location statistics. 

The interface will allow the client to place orders, and the system will determine which location will fulfill the order the fastest based on the number of orders the restaurant already has to complete and its distance. The client can also go through a menu and pick what to order, and it will show the estimated time of arrival. 

The system handles multiple orders at a time, showing order progress from placement to delivery. Order and restaurant information will be stored in a database. 

If the user signs in as an employee, he will be able to select a location and view general statistics about that location such as the total revenue, the total orders, and the average order completion time.
